# Objective
Fully style an HTML5 data table using CSS.

# Process:

1. Use the index.html file, the css folder, and the images folder to create your lab repository. Include the css file found inside the folder.
2. Use css to style the page and table. I don't want it to look like the default browser styling on anything. Use your own css heading, italics, and font weight.
3. DO NOT use a css framework like bootstrap for your css.
4. Add some appropriate headlines, titles, and any other content you think is appropriate to the document.
5. Add html class and id hooks to make your css light and compact.
6. Get data from here: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/
7. Use any 4 of the planets (not pluto or small bodies).
8. Combine the data from any 4 planet pages into a single html page with one single table. I do not want separate tables/pages.
9. Use any seven data fields: i.e., Mass, Diameter, Distance from sun, etc.
10. Grading will be based on requirements and how well it is styled. Try to use images and various css properties to make your page look nice and unique.
11. Goal is to show the data in a nice, readable and pleasant way in a combined table on a single page.
12. Add at least 10 css style declarations.
13. Apply CSS properties to the table via classes or ids on elements.
